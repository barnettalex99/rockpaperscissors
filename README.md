This is an interface that allows a user to play a game to 5 of rock paper scissors against a computer by clicking buttons at the top of the window. It then reports the score after every round. The game finishes when the first person reaches 5 points.

README.md has the README file that explains the purpose of this code.
index.html contains the basic HTML elements shown.
javascript.js contains the javascript that runs the rock paper scissor game and manipulates the DOM.
styles.css contains the css that cleans up the formatting.

This project demonstrates my ability to use javascript and logic to build a game. It also demonstrates my proficiency in using html, css and javascript together to build an effective user interface.
